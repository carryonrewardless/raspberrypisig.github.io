## Soft PLC on Pi
Rob C. showed pi talking to PLC IO module. Talked about a "soft PLC" on pi.

## Grand designs for Hosted Pi cluster at Melbpc 
Sean showed rack mount he had in mind.  

## Exodus(Kodi add on)
Exodus is a great addon for Kodi. You can basically watch latest movies (even ones currently in the cinemas) or TV shows. You can be selective in the range of streaming servers you want to enable, disable slow ones.

I installed it by first adding adding the repository  [http://fusion.tvaddons.ag](http://fusion.tvaddons.ag) 
Then install from zip file -> start here-> Addon Installer. Once the addon installer is enabled, you can download exodus.
