Troubleshooting HTTP APIs is a useful skill to have in your IOT toolkit, especially with REST web services.


A great tool to use is Postman. To use it, you need the Google Chrome web browser. You then locate Postman on the Google Web Store [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/postman/fhbjgbiflinjbdggehcddcbncdddomop?hl=en).


Once installed, type **chrome://apps** in the address bar, then click on Postman.
