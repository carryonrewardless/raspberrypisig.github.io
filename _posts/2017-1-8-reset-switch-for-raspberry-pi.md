The RUN header on the Raspberry pi 3 is now located near pin #39

Found lots of reference for Raspberry Pi 2, but would love to know how applicable it is to Raspberry Pi 3.
They all involve solder a two-pin header on the pinouts marked RUN, then connecting that to a momentary switch. I was also looking for fancy 
solutions like Wake-On-Lan, which I don't think the pi supports. Or perhaps using a always-on Pi zero to somehow do it.
