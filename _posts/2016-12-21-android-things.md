Android Apps can now be run on Raspberry Pi 3. So Android developers who are familiar with writing apps to phone can now also target Raspberry Pi 3.

Microsoft introduced Windows IOT Core which similarly targeted Raspberry Pi for developers familiar with writing apps in Visual Studio. 

Google has released an image for Raspberry Pi 3 [here](https://dl.google.com/dl/androidthings/rpi3/devpreview/1/androidthings_rpi3_devpreview_1.zip)

Like Microsoft's Windows IOT Core, it's pretty bare, there isn't even application launcher or familiar icons.

To write apps, you can download Android Studio [here](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html) and look at the sample apps [here](https://github.com/androidthings)
