I love lists. Top 10 programming languages, favourite PC games of 2016, that kind of thing.


I've been living in a cave, recently I was alerted to awesome curated lists [here](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) and 
awesome list of awesomeness [here](https://github.com/bayandin/awesome-awesomeness). You can really overdose on these to get your geek fix on.
Lots of content on progamming langages, databases, networing etc.
